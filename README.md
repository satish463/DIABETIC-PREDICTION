•We have applied different classification techniques to a DKD dataset for the prediction of DKD. Random forest classification technique is identified as the best performing classifier and accurate prediction method for DKD. Using this techniques for predictive analytics, especially in the medical field, can save time and money. 
•Our project compared six different types of classification algorithms  to identify the best classifier that is suitable for the DKD dataset.
